# Why React?
https://jscomplete.com/learn/why-react

- Its a javascript library used for building user interfaces
- React is small and is not a complete solution. We will need other libraries along with it to form solutions.
- React helps to describe user interface
- React is declarative : we describe react what we want and not how?
- HTML: declarative for static content
- React: declarative for dynamic data

* How exactly not being a framework is a good thing?
- Limited flexibility
	- Do things a certain way
	- hard to deviate
	
- Large and full of features
	- Hard to customize
	- use the whole thing

* Write programs that do one thing and do it well. Write programs to work together. Write programs to handle text streams, becoz that is a universal interface.
* React enables developers to declaratively describe their UIs and model the state of these interfaces.
* A 'language' to model the state of UIs and not the transactions on them.
* The virtual browser (vs DOM API)
* Just javascript
* React Native (for the win)
* Battle-tested
* Declarative language (model UI and state) : React established a new language between developers and browsers that allowed developersto declaratively describe
stateful user interfaces. This means instead of coming up with steps for transactions on their interfaces, developers just describe interfaces in terms of final
state like a function. When transactions happen to that state, React takes care of updating the user interfaces based on that.
